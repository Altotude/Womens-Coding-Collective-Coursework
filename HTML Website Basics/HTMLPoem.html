    <h1>Poem in Blank Rhyme</h1>
    <br />
    <p>by Glyn Maxwell</p>

    <p>This isn't very difficult to do.
    <br />The sky's pink, the morning pretty new.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Last night I met a mate from the old crew.
    <br />We walked too far too late and turned a U</p>
    <br />
    <p>Out of the woods as it got dark. He knew
    <br />I'd spend the evening talking about you</p>
    <br />
    <p>But didn't mind, and when we had to queue
    <br />He made the time fly quickly with his two</p>
    <br />
    <p>Hundred unfunny jokes, plus a big clue
    <br />About his own big heart. Well, the sky's blue</p>
    <br />
    <p>Now over there, I'm standing in the dew
    <br />Remembering and hoping. But it's true:</p>
    <br />
    <p>Days are very many. Days are few.
    <br />I want to be with someone and you're who.</p>
    <br />
